This is the project page for my final research project for CSCI 198. 
I will be using the PyBrain library for constructing a neural network.
The neural network will be used to predict future stock price given various inputs.

INSTALLATION
============

Unix-like OSes (i.e. Linux, Mac OS X)
=====================================

Installation instructions with easy_install:
1) Install pybrain with easy_install pybrain. 
2) Run aifinalproject.py with Python >= 2.7.x

OR

1) Install setuptools/easy_install 
2) Install SciPY and matplotlib with easy_install: (i.e. easy_install scipy && easy_install matplotlib)
3) Navigate to pybrain folder, then follow instructions from there. 

NOTE: I have only tested this on Debian 6.0 x86. For Linux users, it might be better to use your distribution's package manager to install scipy and matplotlib.

Windows
=======
I have not tested this on Windows. Try following the above instructions.
