	* Submitting final project. While the results weren't particulary 
	robust, with a proper dataset this project can be trivially modified
	to produce good results that can be used in a trading strategy.
	* aifinalproject.py Fixed the main program from halting by changing 
	the training parameters. The network is trained for 100 epochs, 5 times 
	per epoch. Made the backprop trainer verbose to display total error
	during the training sequence.

	* aifinalproject.py The training dataset will now be automatically
	generated. Converted each item in nested list to float, then natural log
	is taken for each item. 
	Started building the network with 2 input neurons, 2 hidden neurons, and 1 output neuron.

	* datadumper.py: Created module which will take data from Yahoo! finance 
	and pickle it into a file.
	* aifinalproject.py Created main file that will be used to construct 
	the neural network.
	* ystockquote.py: Fixed an issue where date was being incorrectly passed to the Yahoo! finance API.

	* CHANGELOG: Added changelog to track changes to the project.
	* ystockquote.py: Added ystockquote library for python interface to
	Yahoo! finance. Fixed a TypeError issue present in the original 
	library by creating four local variables that represented ints as
	strings.
